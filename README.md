- **ARRAY**: Implementations related to arrays and array-based data structures.
- **HASHING**: Implementations related to hash tables and hashing algorithms.
- **HEAP**: Implementations related to heaps and priority queues.
- **LINKED-LIST**: Implementations related to linked lists, including singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
- **QUEUE**: Implementations related to queues, including circular queues and dequeues.
- **RECURSION**: Implementations related to recursive algorithms and problems.
- **SORTING**: Implementations related to sorting algorithms, such as merge sort and quick sort.
- **TREES**: Implementations related to tree data structures, including binary search trees (BST) and AVL trees.

## Data Structures

The data structures implemented in this repository include arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, hash tables, heaps, and various types of trees. Each data structure directory contains implementations and examples demonstrating their usage and functionalities.

## Algorithms

The repository also includes implementations of various algorithms, including sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), graph algorithms, and recursive algorithms.
